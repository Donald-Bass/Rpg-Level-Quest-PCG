The overall concept here is to create a PCG System that can generate focused levels for a RPG. To understand what I mean like that think of the levels in games that use PCG like Diablo, or most rougelikes. Levels in those games tend to be sprawling labyrinths with little overall structure. They work fine exploration, but they aren't suited for a lot of the types of gameplay you see in handmade levels in non pcg based games. The biggest thing they are missing is any concept of order. If a game wants the player to encounter a npc who tells a player about a boss before the boss encounters it, or go through a fierce gauntlet of monsters where the players resources are slowly drained room by room, or anything similar the only way these games seem to have to control the order events happen, are to place these events are the start and endpoints of levels the only two points the player is guaranteed to visit, or temporarily abandon PCG, to use a hand designed level that ensures the level matches the intent. The goal for my system is to be able to take a loose intention of a plan for a level, the major events that need to happen, whether they are story, like meeting npc, or gameplay like running into a miniboss or a treasure room, as well as a few other parameters like the pacing between these points and generate a random level that supports that plan.
